# Caderno

A notetaking/writing app that stores your notes (and sync them) using Git & Github. 
Create using `WailsApp` (Go + Vue) with minimal memory consumption (Â±40MB) instead of the 200MB+ of `Electron` apps!

## Work to be done

These are the major goals for this app. Any help is appreciated! 

1. Add tests coverage for Go implementation & Vue Components
2. Improve Layout to include "SubNotes", "Folders" and "Settings"
3. Create `Dark Mode`
4. Integrate Git-Go and create Repositories without CadernoSync
5. Integrate Git versioning for Note created
6. Integrate Github Auth to Sync repositories created with Caderno (as private or public repos)
7. Integrate Bitbucket & Gather requirements for other providers
8. Create Website to display Caderno (and download buttons for Linux, Windows & Mac)
9. Allow Theme integration
